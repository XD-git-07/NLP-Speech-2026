| **Agent Framework** | Agno LLM Agent | Extensible tool-calling capabilities |
| **Audio Processing** | SoundDevice + SoundFile | Real-time audio I/O |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Ollama** - Local LLM server
- **espeak-ng** - Text-to-speech engine
- **Microphone and Speakers** - For voice interaction

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Ollama

**macOS:**
```bash
# Download from https://ollama.com/download/mac
# Or use Homebrew
brew install ollama
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
- Download from [Ollama Windows download page](https://ollama.com/download/windows)

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/XD-git-07/NLP-Speech-2026.git
cd Vocal-Agent

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Kokoro TTS (separate installation)
pip install --no-deps kokoro-onnx==0.4.7
```

### 3. Install System Dependencies

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install espeak-ng
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
```

**Windows:**
1. Visit [eSpeak NG Releases](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases)
2. Download the latest `.msi` file (e.g., `espeak-ng-20191129-b702b03-x64.msi`)
3. Run the installer
4. Add to PATH if needed

### 4. Download Models

**Llama 3.1 8B:**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

**Kokoro TTS Models:**
- Download `kokoro-v1.0.onnx` and `voices-v1.0.bin` from [kokoro-onnx releases](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/tag/model-files-v1.0)
- Place them in the project root directory

### 5. Run the Application

**Start Ollama:**
```bash
ollama serve
```

**In a new terminal, run the agent:**
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. **Start the application** - Run `python main.py`
2. **Wait for initialization** - The system will load models and start listening
3. **Speak naturally** - Ask questions, request information, or have conversations
4. **Listen to responses** - The AI will respond with synthesized speech

### Example Interaction Flow:

```
Listening... Press Ctrl+C to exit ⠋
speak now - Recording started ⠸
recording - Recording stopped

Transcribed: Who won the 2022 FIFA World Cup?
LLM Tool calls...

Response from the knowledge agent: The 2022 FIFA World Cup was won by Argentina, led by Lionel Messi. They defeated France in the final on December 18, 2022.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key settings in `main.py`:

```python
# Audio processing
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
MAX_PHONEME_LENGTH = 500

# Voice synthesis
SPEED = 1.2  # Adjust speech rate (0.5-2.0)
VOICE_PROFILE = "af_heart"  # Choose from voices-v1.0.bin

# Agent settings
MAX_THREADS = 2  # Parallel processing threads
```

### Available Voice Profiles

The `voices-v1.0.bin` file contains multiple voice profiles. You can change the `VOICE_PROFILE` setting to use different voices.

```

## macOS Setup Script

For macOS users, we provide an automated setup script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x vocal_agent_mac.sh

# Run the setup script
./vocal_agent_mac.sh
```

The script will:
- Install Homebrew dependencies
- Download Kokoro models
- Set up the environment
- Start Ollama service
- Launch the application


### Performance Tips

- Use a GPU for faster LLM inference
- Adjust `MAX_THREADS` based on your CPU cores
- Modify `SPEED` setting for preferred speech rate
- Close other audio applications to avoid conflicts


### Adding New Tools

The agent uses the Agno framework, which supports extensible tool calling. To add new capabilities:

1. Check the [Agno Toolkits documentation](https://docs.agno.com/tools/toolkits/toolkits)
2. Implement your tool following the Agno framework
3. Register the tool with the agent in `agent_client.py`
